(** * Productivity of the PikeTree Algorithm  *)
(* we prove that the PikeTree algorithm never gets stuck *)

Theorem piketree_productivity:
  forall pts1, (exists res, pts1 = PTSS_final res) \/ (exists pts2, pike_tree_seen_step pts1 pts2).
Proof.
  intros pts1. destruct pts1; [right|left; eauto].
  destruct active as [|[t gm] active].
  - destruct blocked as [|tgm blocked]; repeat econstructor.
  - destruct (inseen seen t) eqn:SEEN.
    { repeat econstructor; auto. }
    destruct (tree_bfs_step t gm (idx inp)) eqn:STEP;
      try solve[eexists; econstructor; eauto].

(** * Termination of the PikeTree Algorithm  *)
(* We define a measure, based on the total sizes of all trees handled by the algorithm. *)
(* This measure strictly decreases at each step, meaning that the algorithm eventually reaches a final state *)

(* The measure cannot just sum the sizes of the trees inside active and blocked.
   Because the nextchar rule might then not strictly decrease the measure.
   Since the rule is only possible when the blocked list is non-empty, we add a bonus of 1 for any state where the blocked list is non-empty, ensuring that the measure decreases for the rule nextchar.
